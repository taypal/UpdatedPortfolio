# Updated Portfolio

User: 

    I want my future employers to look at my portfolio and want to hire me. 
    I want them to be able to look at it from both their phone and computer.

    They should be able to navigate easily and seamlessly.

Function: 

//My first page is index.html

This page is a get to know me page. It has two paragraphs about me, as well as, a link to my 
Resume, linkedin page, and GitHub page. 

//Second page is portfolio.html

This page has a link to my projects I have worked on either as a group or by myself. 

//Third page is contact.html

This page allows my users to leave me a message. If they do not want to leave a message, they can click on 
"email" and it will pull up their email with my email already in it. They can also select "call" which will bring up 
my phone number asking if the user wants to call me.

//Fourth page is resume.html

This page is linked in my index.html. When the user selects the "resume" button it will send them to this page.
It has a copy of my resume, which you can click on to zoom in on the image. I do have plans to add photocopies of my certifications.
