"As a traveler
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly"

I created a weather application where you are able to see the weather every three hours for the next five days.

The USER will be able to type in a city and push " Click here for the Weather " 
The application will then give the USER the following items:

THE DATE AND TIME 
THE CURRENT WEATHER
TEMPERATURE 
WIND SPEED 
HUMIDITY 

This is a simple to use application.
